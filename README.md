## Problems
* Category filter implementation - couldn't figure out a way of how to store the data & process it
* [FE] - Dates aren't presented as per the screen design
* [FE] - ui-grid headers were to be removed
* [BE] - config files aren't able to locate sql queries ; Workaround - Wrote Query inside DAO directly instead of picking it from Config object.
